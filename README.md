This project focuses on the employees sample database provided by MySQL on their website.
All the tables from the database have been querried and downloaded as .csv files stored in the data_employees folder
The Schema/ERD for the database can also be found in that folder.
The target is to denormalize all the data in the database and consolidate it into a master dataset so that data scientist can analyze the dataset
